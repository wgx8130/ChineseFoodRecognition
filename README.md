Specifically, for the models "ResNet, DenseNet, ResNeXt, SENet, and Vision Transformer", you can directly change the path of dataset and corresponding model to train.
For the models "ConvNeXt and ConvNeXt V2", you should install corresponding packages in https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt and https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt-V2 first. Then, you can fineture the models.
If you find our paper or this repository helpful, please consider citing our paper after it is published.
